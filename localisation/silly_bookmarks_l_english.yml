 BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Brief History"
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection  is about to come in real handy."
 ZRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After several protests and desertions from advisors, Dabiel completely dissolved the German Empire, Forming the Zarchian State, where he assumed totalitarian power and purged most members of opposition "
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the collapse of the German Empire, the Prima Union quickly rose to take over their former dominant position as they became the undisputed superpower of Europe, lead by their dictator Zortokwa who has near absolute power over the realm. "
 SLY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As Pafi was exiled from the Prima Union for committing several warcrimes targetting Zortokwa, Him and his cult following have travelled and settled in Moldova, where the country lives a peaceful and prosperous life in anarchy"
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 ZRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 SLY_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
